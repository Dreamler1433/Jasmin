# Jasmin

The Java Assembler Interpreter has been developed by 2nd term students for the [Chair of Computer Architecture](http://www.lrr.in.tum.de "LRR") at the [Technische Universität München](http://www.tum.de "TUM"). It is designed as a learning tool for x86 assembler. While not implementing all the functionality of a modern Intel Processor, its tutorials allow you to try and understand the basic commands and structures of assembler code.
